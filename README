Pencil Crayons is a color theme I created, inspired by the Tomorrow Night theme by Chris Kempson. I liked the faded colors but wished they were a bit brighter, and the light variants more distinct, so I created Pencil Crayons from the ground up with the goal of emulating the feel of Tomorrow Night while meeting my own desires. The end result is a lot more "pastel" than its inspiration.

I used the Adobe Color tool to choose colors at relative balance with each other, and used a simple brightening tool to create the light variants. The black and white tones were chosen for being some constant distances away from #000000 and #ffffff, and should be symmetrical when mapped on a brightness scale.

While the words in the license are final, as the creator I would personally appreciate if all uses of this theme for aggregatory purposes (ie. repositories of various color schemes for others to choose from) contain an attribution ("created by Roscoe Smith" is enough) or a link back to this respository. It at the very leasts helps people find my various configurations for different software, should they be looking.

If you want any official variations or have any programs you want to see this theme officially support, feel free to create them yourself in a pull request. I'm happy to include community contributions as long as there's enough demand.
